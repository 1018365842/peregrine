Peregrine
=========

Peregrine is a fast and flexible open-source software GNSS receiver. It can be
used as a standalone application to post-process GNSS data all the way to PVT
solutions or as from within [IPython](http://ipython.org/) as a toolkit for
GNSS data exploration.

Peregrine is written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) for flexibility and
ease of development and uses the `libswiftnav` C library for speed.
