Welcome to peregrine's documentation!
=====================================

Peregrine is a fast and flexible open-source software GNSS receiver. It can be
used as a standalone application to post-process GNSS data all the way to PVT
solutions or as from within `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ as a toolkit for
GNSS data exploration.

Peregrine is written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ for flexibility and
ease of development and uses the `libswiftnav` C library for speed.
